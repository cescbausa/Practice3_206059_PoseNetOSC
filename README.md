# Practice3_206059_PoseNetOSC

I adapted the previous practice (SheepRescue) to a game where we have to interact with the upper part of the body.

While with the hands(wrists in posenet) you have to try to collect as much diamonds as possible, with your face (nose in posenet) you have to avoid the big rocks falling from the sky.

There's no limit in collecting diamonds but 3 rock hits end the game.
